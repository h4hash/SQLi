Learning path
Here's how to get the most out of the Web Security Academy

If you're new to web security, it can be difficult to know where to begin. That's why we've created this suggested learning path to point you in the right direction. We recommend completing the labs as you go, but don't be afraid to move on to the next topic if you get stuck. You can go back to the more challenging labs once you've developed your skills further.

When you've started to build up your web security testing skills, you could put them to the test with our Burp Suite Certified Practitioner accreditation. Before you are ready to attempt the Burp Suite Certified Practitioner exam, you should be comfortably able to complete all of the labs within the Web Security Academy labeled "Practitioner" or lower. There is no set time frame for completing the labs, but you must be able to do so without requiring access to the solutions provided.
Server-side topics

For complete beginners, we recommend starting with our server-side topics. These vulnerabilities are typically easier to learn because you only need to understand what's happening on the server. Our materials and labs will help you develop some of the core knowledge and skills that you will rely on time after time.
